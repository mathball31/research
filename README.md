# Formal Verification of Digital Arithmetic Circuits

This is a repository for my work into the formal verification of digital arithmetic circuits.
It mostly consists of python scripts to pre-process `.blif` files, and prepare them to be processed by [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/).
The various `.py` have documentation surrounding how to run the script.
There are also a number of example blif files.

This repository is under active development, and the various non-software files can and will be deleted/changed at will.
