. take multiplier aag, 
    . change a gate to `x 0 0`
        . run through aigtoaig to get .aig (this fixes some weird issues)
        . run through aigmultopoly to get .sing
        . modify spec to match approx
        . run through Singular to get remainder
        . repeat above but with `x 1 1`
    . repeat above with other gates
    . repeat with different approximate spec
